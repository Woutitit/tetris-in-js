	HOW THE GRID WORKS.
	----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	* On the backend the grid is a multidimensional array (or matrix).
	* 0 means a free space.
	* 1 means occupied space.

	This grid matrix will be updated everytime a tetromino spawns, moves, gets destroyed.
	This way we can easily keep track of collision, when to destroy a row and such.

	IMPORTANT: We can use THIS grid in our neural network as state like outlace did.

	This is how a playing field of 10x16 would look like:

	 var grid = [
		[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],
		[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],
		[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],
		[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],
		[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],
		[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],
		[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],
		[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],
		[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],
		[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],
		[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],
		[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],
		[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],
		[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],
		[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],
		[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]
		]

	this.init(colSpan, rowSpan);	// Intializes backend and frontend playing field.
